IL2CPPDumper Folder is a Dependancy and Must be put in the same folder as the compiled program. It is a customized version of IL2CPPDumper that deals with launch args differently. 

Parse the JSON files this tool outputs to make Cheat API's that can get function pointers and typeinfo pointers on demand, advanced hooking API's, also store your offsets externally making for updates without re-compiling the DLL, unless a struct you use gets changed, just press a few buttons in this program, replace the JSON files, and your cheat is running again.


Apeware is a cheat repo on my account - it has a backend I have tailored to work with these JSON files to create a hooking API and a API for getting pointers to methods and typeinfos on the fly.
